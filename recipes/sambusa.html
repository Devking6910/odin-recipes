    <h5>Instructions</h5>
    <h5>Dough*</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the flour to a large mixing bowl 
            and slowly add in the water and oil, 
            kneading as you go. Do this until all 
            of the liquids have been added. If too 
            dry, add a small amount more water. 
            If too moist, add more flour.</li>
        <li>Form the dough into a ball 
            and knead on a flour-dusted 
            surface for an additional 
            10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Place the ball of dough back 
            into the bowl and cover. Set 
            aside while you make the pastry
             "glue" and meat filling.
        </li>

    </ol>

    <h5>Pastry "Glue"</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the flour and water to a 
            small bowl and whisk until a 
            glue-like texture forms. Set 
            aside.
        </li>    
    </ol>
    <h5>Meat filling</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Place ground beef, onion and 
            garlic in a skillet and cook 
            over medium heat until no pink
             remains. Drain of any liquids 
             and then put the mixture in a 
             medium mixing bowl.
        </li>
        <li>Add the remainder of the filling
            ingredients and combine well.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h5>Putting it all together</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Divide the dough into 6 balls. Rolls each ball out into a thin circle. Slice that circle in half, directly down the middle.
        </li>
        <li>Pick up one of the halve and hold it, flat side down. Take the right edge and fold it about ¾ of the way over towards the left. Now take the left side and do the same towards the right. This should create a pocket.
        </li>
        <li>Spread a little of the pastry "glue" with your finger where the two sides overlap to bind them.
        </li>
        <li>Place about 1 ½ tbsp. of the meat mixture into the pocket and press the final flap of dough down over the opening. Use some more of the pastry "glue" to bind. Continue this process until all of the dough is gone and you have 12 sambusa.
        </li>
        <li>Heat the vegetable oil over medium until it is well-heated.***
        </li>
        <li>Cook, 2-4 at a time. For me it took about 2 minutes on each side to achieve a golden-brown color.
        </li>
        <li>Remove from the heat and cool on a paper towel covered plate. Let cool and enjoy!!!
        </li>

    </ol>
