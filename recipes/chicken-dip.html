      <h5>instructions</h5>
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C). Arrange oven rack to the middle of your oven.
        </li>
        <li>In an 8-inch cast-iron skillet (or an ovenproof pan), melt the butter over medium-high heat. Sauté garlic until fragrant (30 seconds). Add the chicken and hot sauce and simmer until sauce has thickened and reduced by half (about 2 minutes).
        </li>

        </li>
        <li>Bake until bubbling around the edges and the cheese has melted (about 10 minutes). Broil (or grill) for a further minute to brown on top.
        </li>
        <li>Immediately garnish with blue cheese and green onions. Serve with vegetable sticks, chips, crusty bread pieces for dipping.

    </ol>
    
    <h5>Notes</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>If you don't have a cast-iron skillet or oven-proof pan: prepare all ingredients as per recipe instructions above in a regular pan on the stove. Then transfer buffalo dip to a 1-quart (1-litre) baking dish.
        </li>
        <li>You can use rotisserie chicken.
        </li>
        <li>Don't like blue cheese? Feel free to omit it. 
        </li>
        <li>Halve the hot sauce amount for a milder dip.
        </li>
        <li>Add more hot sauce for spicier dip.
        </li>

    </ul>
